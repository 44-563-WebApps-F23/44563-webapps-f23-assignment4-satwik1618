            Billing. That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon
            blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in
            there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.
          </p>
          <p>Hovstad (turning round). Hush!—Speak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you.</p>

          <p>
          Dr. Stockmann. Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
          they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
          Mr. Billing</p>
          <p>
            Hovstad. Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
            be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
            enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
            another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
            the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
            the Liberals.
          </p>
          <p>Aslaksen. Yes, but in moderation, Doctor—proceed with moderation.</p>
          <p>Petra. You don't understand me. The burden of this story is that there
            is a supernatural power that looks after the so-called good people in
            this world and makes everything happen for the best in their
            case—while all the so-called bad people are punished.</p>            
           <p>Peter Stockmann. It is pleasing evidence of a public-spirited feeling,
            extremely pleasing evidence. I might almost say I hardly expected it.
            But you have a closer knowledge of public opinion than I.</p>
